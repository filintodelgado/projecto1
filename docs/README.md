# Documentation

This folder contains the documentation of the 
[CineScape Api](../api/) generated using [JSDoc](https://jsdoc.app/).

## JSDoc

JSDoc is a way to document a JavaScript file including the 
[`@type`](https://jsdoc.app/tags-type.html), 
[`@description`](https://jsdoc.app/tags-description.html) 
and others _"tags"_ that will make your code easier to understand.
Text Editors like [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/languages/javascript) 
will understand the syntax and show you
tips and make type checking upon your code.

The [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=HTML&oldformat=true) 
version in this folder was generated using the 
[JSDoc](https://github.com/jsdoc/jsdoc#user-content-installation-and-usage) 
which reads the code in the [/api](../api/) to make it.

JSDoc can be installed via [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) ([Node](https://nodejs.dev/) Package Manager):
```sh
npm install -g jsdoc
```
